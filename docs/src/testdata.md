# Test Data

## Julia logo

- X × Y × Z : 72 mm × 40 mm × 7 mm

## Capital G
This is purely data for software testing.
This "G" is motivated by the ELEGOO logo (which appears to be using Draft B Semi
Bold font, perhaps), but the outline data is not derived from it.

- X × Y × Z : 9.6 mm × 10 mm × 2 mm
